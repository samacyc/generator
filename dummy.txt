Add creamer to blender. Top with frozen berries. Cover with blender lid and pulse until strawberries and creamer come together. Use your ice cream setting, if your blender has one. Scrape down as needed.  Blend until ice cream is thick and creamy.
Serve immediately or scrape into a freezer container (I use a bread loaf pan). Cover with wax paper to keep ice crystals from forming on the top. Freeze until ready to serve, 2 hours to 2 weeks.
Scoop and Enjoy!
